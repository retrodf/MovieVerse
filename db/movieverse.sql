Two years later, the same director, Peter Sollett, suggested expanding the short film into a feature-length movie: Raising Victor Vargas, which went on to win Rasuk an Independent Spirit Award for his work. In his next film, Rock Steady, Rasuk played a character named Roc. Two years later, he took a leading role in Haven with Orlando Bloom. In 2005, Lords of Dogtown was released, with Victor playing Tony Alva, one of the leading roles. The part included surfing and performing skateboarding tricks. Although the more complicated maneuvers were performed by stunt men (including the scenes of surfing at Pacific Ocean Park pier and skating in empty swimming pools), Rasuk is a method actor and worked on remaining in character both on and off screen. Believing he had mastered skating a huge ramp in only his second week of training, Rasuk fractured one of his orbital bones.

At 16, she left for London and soon became involved in indie filmmaking (her first paid gig was as a stoner in Irvine Welsh\'\'s The Acid House (1998)) and theatre, both as an actress and director. A move to Los Angeles in 2004 brought on more theatre, including a production of \"The Woolgatherer\", in which she directed Anne Dudek (a regular on Mad Men (2007)/Big Love (2006)) and David Dayan Fisher (a regular on 24 (2001)/NCIS (2003)) to great reviews. She then landed her first US movie role as the manipulative, born-again Christian, \"Stacy\", in Headspace (2005). It was as the wild \"Thumper Wint\" in the comedy, Sex and Death 101 (2007) (Simon Baker/Winona Ryder), by Heathers (1988) writer Daniel Waters, that the critics began to take note of her talent, citing a unique blend of powerful sexuality and irreverent humor. Working in both LA and London, Exam (2009) was next, BAFTA-nominated as Outstanding British Debut and winner of Best Independent at the Santa Barbara Film Fest, the film\'\'s critics noted Pollyanna\'\'s performance was \"smart, sassy and sexy in equal parts....the emotional center of the film\" praised her capacity to find the \"emotional vulnerability\" of her seemingly tough and ambitious character. GQ simply stated \"stunning Pollyanna McIntosh is an enormously talented actress\". Como Quien No Quiere La Cosa (2013) (As if you Don\'\'t Like it!), is a hilarious South American farce in which she plays Brit comedian Trevor Lock\'\'s disgruntled wife. Shot in Peru, she speaks Spanish throughout. In Burke and Hare (2010), directed by John Landis, she plays Isla Fisher\'\'s bestie with Simon Pegg, Andy Serkis, Jessica Hynes, Tom Wilkinson and Tim Curry. Her demanding turn as the lead in Lucky McKee\'\'s The Woman (2011) made shock waves at Sundance 2011, brought rave reviews and topped the New York Times readers\'\' favorite movies poll. For her performance, she was awarded three Best Actress awards, including Total Film\'\'s Frightfest Award and Fright Meter\'\'s. As the female lead in the BBC political comedy, Bob Servant Independent (2013), starring Brian Cox, she played the professionally critical \"Philippa Edwards\", a very different sort of scary. In festival darling, Love Eternal (2013), she plays the female lead as a suicidal grieving mother. In the raucous Filth (2013), she played opposite James McAvoy and Jamie Bell, in the adaptation of Irvine Welsh\'\'s balls-out novel as the lusty Size Queen. Two successful British thrillers that see Pollyanna go from vulnerable to kick ass are White Settlers (2014), (known in the USA as The Bloodlands) and Let Us Prey also starring Game of Thrones\'\' Liam Cunningham. In Sundance TV\'\'s Hap and Leonard also starring James Purefoy, Michael Kenneth Williams and Christina Hendricks, Pollyanna is nothing but kick ass as the neon-clad psycho killer, Angel. In US indy comedies Prevertere and The Famous Joe Project Pollyanna played it characteristically unsafe once again. Possibly her strangest role yet has been as Bobby in Ding Dong, teaming up once again with Lucky McKee for the 2014 anthology film Tales of Halloween. Pollyanna will next be seen in Blood on Wheels as the vicious biker gang leader Trigga. The film is produced by James Franco.', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/n9jfF6pEutTz6qeofHFz2mxh95e.jpg'),

During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962.\r\n\r\nAt the RCA he contributed to the college magazine, ARK and helped to establish its film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring his younger brother, Tony Scott, and his father. The film\'\'s main visual elements would become features of Scott\'\'s later work; it was issued on the \'\'Extras\'\' section of The Duellists DVD. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and the science fiction series Out of the Unknown. Scott was an admirer of Stanley Kubrick early in his development as a director. For his entry to the BBC traineeship, Scott remade Paths of Glory as a short film.\r\n\r\nHe was assigned to design the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the famous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant that he was replaced on the serial by Raymond Cusick.\r\n\r\nAt the BBC, Scott was placed into a director training programme and, before he left the corporation, had directed episodes of Z-Cars, its spin-off, Softly, Softly, and adventure series Adam Adamant Lives!\r\n\r\nIn 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.Five members of the Scott family are directors, all working for RSA.

His directorial fame escalated with the release of The Godfather in 1972. The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, garnering universal laurels from critics and public alike. It went on to win three Academy Awards, including his second, which he won for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was instrumental in cementing his position as one of the prominent American film directors. Coppola followed it with an equally successful sequel The Godfather Part II, which became the first ever sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film received yet higher praises than its predecessor, and gave him three Academy Awards—for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture. In the same year was released The Conversation, which he directed, produced and wrote. The film went on to win the Palme d\'\'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival.
